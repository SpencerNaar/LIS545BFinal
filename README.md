### SUMMARY

The data in this project are long-term cumulative groundwater depletion rates and groundwater volume changes in the earth's subsurfaces. Data is collected from forty separate aquifer systems and one land use area within the United States between 1900 and 2008. This repository includes the following items:

### 1) DATASET FILES

There is one zip file which contains the dataset for the project *Groundwater depletion in the United States (1900-2008): A Scientific Investigations Report* by Leonard F. Knikow published in 2013 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The data is included as six .xls files in the Spreadsheets Folder and the metadata is included as multiple .dbf,.prj,.sbn,.sbx,.shp,.shx and xml files in the Database Folder under Aquifers and Basemap. They are structured according to [FGDC Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata.](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm-standard)

    
    Spreadsheets Folder
        Depletion Average Rates (1961-1970)
        Depletion Average Rates (2001-2008)
        Depletion Volumes (1900-2000)
        Depletion Volumes (1900-2008)
        High Plains: Average rates & depletion volumes for the states of CO, KS, NE, NM, OK, SD, TX, and WY.
        U.S. Map Data: Depletion volume, size of area, Average rate of depletion and depletion intensity.
               
    Database Folder
        Aquifers: Metadata on aquifer systems and land use area.
        Basemap: Metadata on groundwater basemap.

### 2) DATA DEFINITIONS & CONVERSION FACTORS

This PDF file contains definitions for the column headings in the six .xls files in the Spreadsheets Folder, methodology explanations for estimating groundwater depletion, and conversion factors for estimated data calculations.

### 3) METADATA

Structured discovery-level metadata using DataCite Metadata Schema 4.4.
