### SUMMARY

The data in this project are long-term cumulative groundwater depletion rates and groundwater volume changes in the earth's subsurfaces. Data is collected from forty separate aquifer systems and one land use area within the United States between 1900 and 2008.

### DATA FILES

There is one zip file which contains the dataset for the project *Groundwater depletion in the United States (1900-2008): A Scientific Investigations Report* by Leonard F. Knikow published in 2013 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The data is included as six .xls files in the Spreadsheets Folder and the metadata is included as multiple .dbf,.prj,.sbn,.sbx,.shp,.shx and xml files in the Database Folder under Aquifers and Basemap. They are structured according to FGDC Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata.

### Metadata



2. Metadata [Pending - Additional info needed for Final Project: FGDC standard is now considered out of date, but it is still used across USGS data centers. USGS supposedly moving to the newer ISO 19115 standard but this has not occured yet. <metstdn>FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata</metstdn>
    <metstdv>FGDC-STD-001-1998</metstdv>]


3. Data & Metadata Profile: USGS Water Mission Area NSDI Node [Pending - Additional info needed for Final Project: provide a brief discussion of what programs might be needed to read these file formats. Given that this collection includes a number of formats, some of which are more obscure (e.g. prj), this would be a useful detail for potential users]
